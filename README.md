# DeapDream

DeapDream is a project that uses the DeepDream algorithm to generate images. The DeepDream algorithm is a computer vision algorithm that uses a convolutional neural network to enhance patterns in images. The algorithm works by maximizing the activation of a specific layer in the neural network. This results in the enhancement of patterns and features in the image, creating a dream-like effect.
